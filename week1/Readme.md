#CHAPTER 1

Object: A program component that contains data and performs operations. Property: A setting that controls an object's appearance or characteristics. Method: A group of statements that performs a specific operation. Class: A blueprint that describes a type of object. Control: An object used in a GUI, such as a Button, Label, or TextBox. .NET Framework: A collection of classes and tools used to develop Windows applications.

Visual Studio
Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to design, write, run, and debug applications.

Main tools:

Designer Window: Used to create the application's interface. Solution Explorer: Displays projects and their files. Properties Window: Used to view and change object properties. Toolbox: Contains controls that can be added to a form. Toolbar: Provides shortcuts to frequently used commands. Project: Contains the files and resources for an application.

Solution: A container that can hold one or more projects.

Forms and Controls
Form: A window that provides the main interface of an application. GUI: A visual interface that allows users to interact with a program. Bounding Box: The dotted outline around a selected form or control. Sizing Handles: Small points used to resize objects. Properties: Settings used to change an object's appearance and behavior. Controls can be added from the Toolbox, moved, resized, and configured through the Properties Window.

Identifiers are names used to identify controls in code. The chapter introduces camelCase, a naming convention that starts with a lowercase letter and capitalizes subsequent words.

Introduction to C# Code
C# code is organized into three main structures:

Namespace: A container for classes. Class: A container for methods and other class members. Method: A group of statements that performs an operation. A Windows Forms project commonly includes:

Program.cs: Contains the application's startup code. Form1.cs: Contains code associated with the form.

Event-Driven Programming
Event-driven programming is a programming approach in which an application responds to user actions.

Event: An action, such as clicking a button or pressing a key. Event Handler: A method that runs when a specific event occurs. Message Box: A dialog box used to display messages to users. The Hello World application demonstrates how a button click can trigger a message to appear.

Common Controls
Label: Displays text or program output on a form. PictureBox: Displays images on a form. Button: Allows users to trigger actions by clicking it. TextBox: Allows users to enter or edit text. The Label control has properties such as Text, Font, Name, and TextAlign. The PictureBox control includes Image, SizeMode, and Visible properties.

IntelliSense
IntelliSense is Visual Studio's code-completion feature. It suggests available keywords, methods, variables, classes, and properties as programmers type.

It helps improve coding speed and reduces typing mistakes.

Code Readability and Execution
Sequential Execution: Statements run in the order they appear. Comments: Notes in the source code that explain how the program works. Blank Lines: Separate sections of code to improve readability. Indentation: Spacing that shows the structure of the code. Correct statement order is important for achieving the intended program result.

Closing an Application
The chapter introduces two ways to close an application:

this.Close() -- Closes the current form. Application.Exit() -- Exits the entire application.

Syntax Errors
A syntax error occurs when code does not follow the grammatical rules of C#.

Visual Studio identifies many syntax errors with a red underline. Programmers should inspect and correct the highlighted code before running the application.

A logic error occurs when a program runs but produces an incorrect result.

Summary In Week 1, we learned the fundamentals of Visual C# and Windows Forms development. We explored objects, properties, methods, controls, and the main features of Visual Studio.

We also learned how to create a form, design a GUI, organize C# code, and use event handlers to respond to user actions. Finally, we studied common controls, IntelliSense, code readability, and error identification.

Key takeaway: Visual C# combines interface design and programming to create applications that respond to user actions.
